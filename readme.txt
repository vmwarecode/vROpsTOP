OVERVIEW
===============
The vROpsTOP dashboard is meant to be like using ESXTOP to look at host and VM stats. This is not a 1:1 mapping but more of a similar group of metrics. One advantage here is having a list of the VM's CPU, Memory, Network and Disk info all on one page. This is a basic dashboard with five object pickers. No additional views or metric configs are needed. However, policy may need some metrics enabled or they could show up as question marks. A sample policy with all metrics enabled is included.

Select a host and the details for all VMs on that host are displayed in the panes below.

- Click columns to sort greatest to smallest or smallest to greatest
- Hover over the top right corner of each section to get the "show toolbar" box to enter text to filter on
- Update refresh intervals as needed, however still limited by vROps polling intervals
- Edit the widget > click pick metrics > update box labels with KPI thresholds per your standards i.e. “CPU Contention (%) (<6!)” to show a value of 6 or higher needs investigation
